	{		
		LookingAtMercury=Mercury's surface is covered with craters of various ages; the ejecta from some newer craters is clearly visible through the telescope.
		LookingAtVenus=Faint changes in the cloud cover suggest the presence of some high altitude mountains or volcanoes in this area.
		LookingAtMoon=Much of the Moon's bright surface is covered with overlapping craters.
		LookingAtMars=There seem to be a lot of red things on Mars, closer inspection is warranted.
		LookingAtDeimos=This thing looks more like a large asteroid than a moon when viewed up close.
		LookingAtPhobos=Up close, Phobos resembles nothing if not a large, very dark, asteroid.
		LookingAtJupiter=Bands of different coloured clouds are visible in Jupiter's atmosphere; each band being driven in opposite directions by fierce winds.
		LookingAtIo=Colourful yellow, red, and sometimes green materials coat areas of Io's surface, sometimes centered around active volcanoes.
		LookingAtEuropa=Relatively smooth, bright white terrain covers most of Europa's surface.
		LookingAtGanymede=Ganymede's terrain is heavily cratered in most areas and appears to be mostly water ice covered by a thin layer of dark regolith.
		LookingAtCallisto=The surface of Callisto is almost saturated with impact craters, every further impact will almost always overlap with older craters.
		LookingAtSaturn=Saturn's thick cloud layer obscures all but the outermost layers of its atmosphere.
		LookingAtTitan=Dense clouds obscure most of the surface in the visible portion of the spectrum, providing little useful data.
		LookingAtUranus=Uranus' light blue and white clouds cover the entire planet, obscuring any observations of its interior.
		LookingAtPluto=Pluto looks a bit dim and blurry from this distance, a closer view will be necessary to see any details.

	{		
		MercurySrfLanded=Scans of vaporized surface materials indicate that Mercury is nearly entirely covered with layers of igneous rock.
		VenusSrfLanded=Laser analysis of the surface of Venus reveals an elemental composition similar to that of most rocky planets; primarily silicate in nature.
		MoonSrfLanded=Sustained blasts from the laser vaporize the surface layers of Lunar regolith, however nothing but more regolith is discovered below.
		MarsSrfLanded=Significant concentrations of iron oxide are detected in the surface of Mars, the presence of which is responsible for the planet's red colouring.
		DeimosSrfLanded=The loosely compacted surface of Deimos is nearly blasted apart by the laser beam. Nothing but ordinary silicates are detected in the vaporized remains.
		PhobosSrfLanded=Scans of the surface of Phobos reveal silicate minerals common to many types of asteroids.		
		IoSrfLanded=Traces of various sulfur compounds are detected in scans of Io's surface.
		EuropaSrfLanded=The laser bores a surprisingly deep hole in Europa's surface, releasing a significant amount of steam.
		GanymedeSrfLanded=Scans of Ganymede's surface reveal a mix of water ice, silicate compounds, along with traces of some organic compounds.
		CallistoSrfLanded=Signs of water ice are found covering most of the surface of Callisto.
		TitanSrfLanded=The laser vaporizes a sample of Titan's surface, producing a brownish cloud of energetic dust.
		PlutoSrfLanded=Scans of the surface here reveal mostly oxygen and hydrogen, probably in the form of water ice.
